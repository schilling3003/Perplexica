# Restaurant Search Agent Improvements for Specialty Cheese Program

## Overview

The current implementation of the Restaurant Search Agent returns an overview of the restaurant, but it does not provide a numerical score or a detailed summary explaining why a restaurant is or is not a good fit for the specialty cheese program. This markdown outlines the necessary changes to achieve this goal.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Scoring Implementation
- **Objective:** Introduce a scoring system (e.g., 0-100 scale) that evaluates each restaurant based on specific criteria related to the specialty cheese program.
- **Criteria Examples:**
  - Menu focus on cheese-based dishes or specialty cheeses.
  - Quality of cheese pairings with other menu items.
  - Ambiance and service quality relevant to a gourmet cheese experience.
  - Local sourcing and uniqueness of cheese offerings.
- **Implementation:**
  - Update the core evaluation function to calculate a numerical score for each restaurant.
  - Consider weighting the criteria to reflect their relative importance.

### 2. Summary Generation
- **Objective:** Generate a detailed natural language summary that explains the restaurant's suitability for the specialty cheese program.
- **Content of the Summary:**
  - Key strengths (e.g., standout cheese dishes or innovative pairings).
  - Areas for improvement (e.g., limited cheese offerings or mismatch with program goals).
  - Overall recommendation based on the computed score.
- **Implementation:**
  - Extend the existing output payload of the agent to include a textual summary alongside the score.
  - Update prompt templates to instruct the AI to produce both the score and the summary.

### 3. Code Modifications
- **Restaurant Evaluation Function:**
  - Modify the function responsible for analyzing restaurant data to include the new scoring logic.
  - Ensure that the function returns both a numeric score and a written summary.

- **Output Structure:**
  - Update the output format so that the responses include both the computed score and the detailed summary.
  - Example JSON output:
    ```json
    {
      "restaurantName": "Example Bistro",
      "overview": "A nice restaurant with a focus on local ingredients.",
      "score": 85,
      "summary": "Example Bistro scores high due to its innovative cheese pairings and commitment to locally-sourced, high-quality cheeses. However, there's room for improvement in expanding its menu variety."
    }
    ```

### 4. Testing & Validation
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Add tests to verify that the scoring logic correctly handles a range of restaurant profiles.
  - Validate that the summary accurately reflects the computed score and underlying criteria.

- **Integration Tests:**
  - Run end-to-end tests to ensure that the updated agent integrates seamlessly with the rest of the system.

## Next Steps

1. **Development:**
   - Refactor the evaluation logic to incorporate the scoring and summary generation.

2. **Code Reviews:**
   - Have the changes reviewed by peers to ensure the modifications meet the program's goals.

3. **Deployment:**
   - After thorough testing, deploy the updated agent and monitor its performance for further improvements.

4. **Feedback Collection:**
   - Gather feedback from users on the new functionality to iterate and refine scoring criteria if necessary.
